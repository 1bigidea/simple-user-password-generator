Allows administrators to generate a secure password when adding new users.

== Description ==

Users with the ability to add new users (typically just administrators) have a new button on the add users screen that allows them to generate a secure password.

Also adds a "Encourage the user to change their password, once logged in." checkbox (checked automatically when generating a password) that encourages the user to change their password to something more memorable. The password change suggestion appears on the top of admin pages, and can be easily dismissed.

Simple and light weight. No new settings pages or configuration screens, and nothing added to the database. Just install and go!

Localization ready; includes Spanish translation. Other translations welcome!
